<p>The overall aim of "The ASCII Project" is to develop a Unicode graphics based "Roguelike" MMORPG engine which operates a persistent world driven by a player-run economy.</p>

<h1>News</h1>

<p>11/22/12</p>

<pre><code>   Almost finished with saving and loading maps to disk, which is necessary for some of the world "sculpting" things I am going to try.
</code></pre>

<p>11/12/12 </p>

<pre><code>We've moved on up to 0.0.1, as I'm now about to pull in major revisions from bits of code I've been experimenting with 
</code></pre>

<p>lately. This code does compile, but I intend on getting back into a code frenzy, so don't tie yourself to anything yet.</p>

<h1>GOALS</h1>

<pre><code>* Players can "destroy" and place blocks and items to create persistent structures, in much the same way that Minecraft allows players to work together to build constructions.

* The game world will run and operate independent of player-input. NPC's will continue to develop and operate when nobody is logged into the server.

* The game world will operate in a 3-Dimensional space, allowing for an "advanced" physics engine and opening the door to new possibilities.

* NPC's will operate independent of eachother, in that each has the ability to make their own decisions based on their relationships with players and other NPC's.

* The above mentioned relationships will continue to develop amongst NPC's without any player input.

    * All C++ source code will remain 100% C++11 compliant, including 3rd party libraries. If changes are necessary to 
</code></pre>

<p>those libraries to remain standards compliant, they will be made where possible. Otherwise we will defer to another library or write our own if necessary.</p>

<pre><code>* TBA - I would rather be coding that writing up this readme file, please refer to the homepage at http://www.theasciiproject.com and the wiki at http://www.theasciiproject.com/wk/ for more information.
